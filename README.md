**Challenge Statement 16: Migrant Connect**

India is home to over 450 million internal migrant workers who often move across state borders in search of work. However, this mobility comes at a cost. It disrupts their access to essential public services like healthcare, education, financial aid, and social welfare programs.  

These migrant workers encounter several barriers:
- Lack of portable digital identity and documents across states  
- Language and literacy barriers that limit access to digital platforms
